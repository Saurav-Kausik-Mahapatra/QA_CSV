# CSV Query & Visualization Tool

This is a Gradio-based application that allows users to query a CSV file and visualize the data using graphs.

## Features

1. **CSV Query**: Users can enter a query, and the application will provide a concise answer based on the data in the CSV file. The query is processed using the Pydantic AI framework and Ollama's local LLM.

2. **Graph Visualization**: Users can select two columns from the CSV file to generate a scatter plot. The plot is generated using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
